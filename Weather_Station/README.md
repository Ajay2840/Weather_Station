# Weather Station using Arduino

This project uses **DHT11** and **BMP180** sensors to measure:
- 🌡️ Temperature
- 💧 Humidity
- 📈 Atmospheric Pressure

The data is printed on the Arduino Serial Monitor every 2 seconds.

## 🧰 Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- DHT11 Sensor
- BMP180 Sensor
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard
- USB Cable

## 📚 Libraries Required
Make sure to install these libraries from Arduino Library Manager:
- `DHT sensor library` by Adafruit
- `Adafruit Unified Sensor`
- `Adafruit BMP085 Unified` (also works for BMP180)
